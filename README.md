# **Welcome to repository for  Test for Web App Developers**
## Front-End
This application is made in REACT with the CSS framework Tailwind.

To run the application you need to have installed node.
Run the commands:

*npm install*

*npm run dev *or* npm run build*

#### I built this application to run in the browser,so it doesnt need a Backend since it runs all the scripts in javascript. These scripts are located in the utils folder.
